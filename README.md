# Resume

Hi, I am **Niclas van Eyk**, a software developer located in Osnabrück, Germany.
Next to my diverse formal education, I have 8 years of experience building web applications.
I am always curious to learn new things and enjoy working in teams.

## Work Experience

### **[2024 – Present]** Team Internet AG

For [Team Internet](https://www.teaminternet.de/en) (the *AG*, which is part of the [PLC with the same name](https://teaminternet.com)), I work on analytical dashboards, data visualizations and everything related.
Using React and FastAPI, we derive insights from data sourced throughout the company.

### **[2016 – 2024]** neusta Infomantis

To finance my studies and obtain practical experience I started working as a web developer at [neusta Infomantis](https://neusta-infomantis.de).
As a part of the [team neusta](https://www.team-neusta.de) group, one of the largest software development agencies in Germany, I helped building multiple projects, using a variety of technologies.
Examples include APIs supporting offline-first sales apps, analytical dashboarding software, and booking systems.

As a full-stack developer, my work consisted of building any backend services with Laravel (which I obtained a [certificate](https://exam.laravelcert.com/is/niclas-van-eyk/certified-since/2023-07-15) for), as well as the user interface with preferably React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
Additionally, I also got exposure to several other technologies, such as Angular, Java Spring Boot, Docker, and AWS.
Next to implementing business requirements, I also worked closely with our operations team, shaping our continuous integration pipelines, observability tooling, and other parts of our internal infrastructure.

## Open Source

Back in 2017 I encountered a small issue with Google's Polymer project and decided to fix it myself.
It [being accepted and merged](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/pull/903) sparked my interest in open-source software and motivated me to publish some of my own work (such as this document, which is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/resume#open-source:~:text=publicly%20available%20on%20GitHub)).
Examples of my contributions include the [Laravel PHP framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commits?author=NiclasvanEyk), where I improved type definitions and the integration between the default error page for docker-based projects, or the popular [VS Code Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commits?author=NiclasvanEyk), where I added a link to clear any applied filters when a search on the settings page yields no results.

I also created a few open-source projects on my own.
The ones I am most proud of are the following:

- [**Make for Laravel**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14612-laravel-make) – An IDE-Plugin that integrates several features of the Laravel PHP framework into the JetBrains family of editors.
  It is written in Kotlin and at the time of writing was **downloaded over 50k times**.
- [**Initializer for Laravel**](https://laravel.initializer.dev) – A web-based project generator for new Laravel projects.
  So far **more than 1500 projects** were downloaded by people all over the world.
- [**Keepac**](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/keepac) – A command line application written in Go, enabling you to edit your `CHANGELOG.md` similar to `git commit`.

## Formal Education

I obtained two computer science degrees, a bachelor's with a focus on media applications and a masters specializing in working with and extracting information from data.

### **[2019 – 2023]** Master of Science ([Data Science and Technology](https://www.utwente.nl/en/csc/programme/specializations/data-science-and-technology))

In order to specialize in working with data and get to know a different country I decided to study the computer science master in the Netherlands at the University of Twente.

I learned data visualization techniques, how to solve classification, regression, and information retrieval problems and regularly applied everything to examples or research projects.
The courses also tackled problems like using these skills when dealing with big data.

For my [final thesis](https://essay.utwente.nl/94455), I collaborated with the team at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) to come up with a new approach for surfacing and automatically detecting phishing content on their platform.

- Concepts: Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Distributed Systems
- Languages: Python
- Technologies: Hadoop, Spark, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, FastAPI

### **[2014 – 2018]** Bachelor of Science ([Computer Science and Media Applications](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/en/study/study-offerings/bachelor/computer-science-and-media-applications-bsc))

I obtained a BSc from the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabrück, Germany.
During my studies, I learned about important concepts from math, programming, algorithms and data structures, user interface design, and project management.

In my final thesis, I created a conceptual data platform integrating heterogeneous data sources for the [OPeRAte research project](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/en/research/search/laboratories-and-testing-facilities/lab-for-rf-frequency-and-mobile-communication/projects/operate/).

- Concepts: Operating Systems, Networking, System Architecture, Project Management
- Languages: Java, C, C++, PHP, JavaScript
- Technologies: Laravel, Spring Boot
