# Resume

Hi, I am **Niclas van Eyk**, a software developer located in Osnabrück, Germany.
Next to my diverse formal education, I have 9 years of professional experience building software.
I am always curious to learn new things, enjoy working in teams, and passionate about open source.

## Work Experience

### Team Internet AG (Since 2024)

For [Team Internet](https://www.teaminternet.de/en), I began working on analytical dashboards.
Using React and FastAPI, we derived insights from data sourced throughout the company.
I also helped building the necessary data pipelines, utilized serverless computing techniques, and managed data lakes.

More recently, I switched focus to an LLM-based application for ensuring compliance.
Here I help with observability tooling, data engineering, and evaluating the classification results of our system.
An achievement I am especially proud of, is driving the development of a streamlined approach Python packaging and dependency management.
This enabled seamless code sharing across our various deployment units, helping the whole team re-use existing pieces of functionality.

### Neusta Infomantis (2016 – 2024)

To finance my studies and obtain practical experience I started working as a full-stack developer at [neusta Infomantis](https://neusta-infomantis.de), building multiple projects using a variety of technologies.
Examples include APIs supporting offline-first sales apps, analytical dashboarding software, and booking systems, which were mostly realized in PHP using Laravel and React.
Next to implementing business requirements, I also worked closely with our operations team, shaping our continuous integration pipelines, observability tooling, and other parts of our internal infrastructure.

## Open Source

Back in 2017 I encountered a small issue with Google's Polymer project and decided to fix it myself.
It [being accepted and merged](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/pull/903) sparked my interest in open-source software and motivated me to publish some of my own work (such as this document, which is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/resume#open-source:~:text=publicly%20available%20on%20GitHub)).
Examples of my contributions include the [Laravel PHP framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commits?author=NiclasvanEyk), or the popular [VS Code Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commits?author=NiclasvanEyk).

I also created a few open-source projects on my own.
The ones I am most proud of are the following:

- [**Make for Laravel**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14612-laravel-make) ([GitHub](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/jetbrains-laravel-make-integration)) – An IDE-plugin that integrates several features of the Laravel PHP framework into the JetBrains family of editors.
  It is written in Kotlin and at the time of writing was **downloaded over 80k times**.
- [**Keepac**](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/keepac) – A command line application written in Go, enabling you to edit your `CHANGELOG.md` similar to `git commit`.
- [**Chers**](https://chers.niclasve.me) ([GitHub](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/chers)) – A chess implementation written in Rust, usable through WebAssembly online, or locally in your terminal.

## Formal Education

I obtained two computer science degrees, a bachelor's with a focus on media applications and a masters specializing in working with and extracting information from data.

### Master of Science, [Data Science and Technology](https://www.utwente.nl/en/csc/programme/specializations/data-science-and-technology) (2019 – 2023)

In order to specialize in working with data and get to know a different country I decided to study the computer science master in the Netherlands at the University of Twente.

I learned data visualization techniques, how to solve classification, regression, and information retrieval problems and regularly applied everything to examples or research projects.
The courses also tackled problems like using these skills when dealing with big data.

For my [final thesis](https://essay.utwente.nl/94455), I collaborated with the team at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) to come up with a new approach for surfacing and automatically detecting phishing content on their platform.

### Bachelor of Science, [Computer Science & Media Applications](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/en/study/study-offerings/bachelor/computer-science-and-media-applications-bsc) (2014 – 2018)

I obtained a BSc from the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabrück, Germany.
During my studies, I learned about important concepts from math, programming, algorithms and data structures, user interface design, and project management.

In my final thesis, I created a conceptual data platform integrating heterogeneous data sources for the [OPeRAte research project](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/en/research/search/laboratories-and-testing-facilities/lab-for-rf-frequency-and-mobile-communication/projects/operate/).
